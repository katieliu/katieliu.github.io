	<p>My passion for computers gives me the drive to create art using computer software.  I enhance my photos to be the best possible finished product with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, software that I have been familiar with since I started doing photography in 2012. Additionally, my understanding and use of both Canon and Nikon products allow me to take photos that need little to no post-processing work. If you are interested in seeing some of my photography work, please visit my <a href="http://kdlphoto.portfoliobox.net"target="_blank">portfolio</a> website.<br/>

	<p>I understand that technology is a growing phenomenon that changes the world day by day and I want to be a part of the changes, starting with web design and development. I am currently working on furthering my knowledge of Javascript after having already self-learned and explored HTML, CSS, jquery, bootstrap, and a little bit of PHP. My goal is to be able to build beautiful, responsive, and interactive web apps within one or two years of self-learning.<br/>
