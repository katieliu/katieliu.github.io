<div class="about">
	<p>I am that snow cone on a 27 degree day. I am a fish that can survive above water. I am a cactus when I'm in my zone. <br/> My name is Katie and I am a student in Ryerson University's hospitality and tourism management program.<br/>Above all of it, school, work, and everything in between, lies my favorite thing... computers. I have recently begun teaching myself a variety of different computer languages. That's why I've decided to build this website, not only to showcase some of my skills but to also have a really good time. </p></div>

	<p>My passion for computers gives me the drive to create art using computer software.  I enhance my photos to be the best possible finished product with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, software that I have been familiar with since I started doing photography in 2012. Additionally, my understanding and use of both Canon and Nikon products allow me to take photos that need little to no post-processing work. If you are interested in seeing some of my photography work, please visit my <a href="http://kdlphoto.portfoliobox.net"target="_blank">portfolio</a> website.<br/>
